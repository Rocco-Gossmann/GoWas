# Text Display

Text Displays are reminiscent of the "Text-Mode" you would find on a C64, 
AppleII or even old DOS computers.

This means, you have an invisible Cursor and you can print characters/runes at the location of the cursor.

Since the Text-Display itself is based on a [TileMap](./TileMap.md), you can also exchange its
underlying [TileSet](./TileSets.md) to change the Font or to use it 
as a rudimentary graphics display.
